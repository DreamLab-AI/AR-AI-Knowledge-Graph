/**
 * AgentTrail.tsx
 * A fading motion-trail ribbon behind a single agent body — "watch the swarm move".
 *
 * The trail source is the agent's *lerped* world position (BotsNode's
 * currentPositionRef, updated each frame by useFrame lerp 0.15 toward the server
 * position). This layer is mounted as a SIBLING of the moving agent group, so its
 * vertices live in the same parent (world) space and stay put while the agent flies
 * on — a genuine trail, not a rigid attachment.
 *
 * Sampling is time-gated (~120ms, not per-frame) and displacement-gated: an idle
 * agent (displacement < epsilon) grows no trail, and a moving one decays its tail by
 * ring-buffer rotation (the fixed-length buffer overwrites the oldest sample).
 *
 * Rendering follows the repo idioms (cf. TransientBeamsLayer, BotsEdges): a single
 * THREE.Line whose position + colour attributes are pre-allocated once and mutated in
 * place — zero per-frame allocation. The oldest→newest fade is baked into the vertex
 * colours under additive blending (the bioluminescent idiom shared with BotsNode's
 * nucleus glow), so a fading vertex tends to black = transparent, exactly the
 * opacity-envelope shape TransientBeamsLayer uses for its beams.
